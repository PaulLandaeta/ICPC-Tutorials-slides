# ICPC tutorial/slides

This repository was initiated with my talk at ***ICCECE, IEEE*** held at Kolkata in January,2019.

`talk.pdf`(`talk.tex`) is the root presentation(tex) of presentation made by me. I detoured to other presentations as and when necessary(Was too lazy to merge! :p)

Other slides and works are adapted from other institutes programming pages that are published online.

I would like to give due **credits** to the slide/notes owners:

1. `BinarySearch.pdf`: Bhavit Sharma and Prateek Karnal, IIT Patna
2. `graph.pdf`,`not_covered/Number Theory.pdf`: Programming And Algorithms Group(PAG), IIT Roorkee
3. `icpc.pdf`(`icpc.tex`): IIT Bombay
4. `dynamic-programming_stanford.pdf`: Prof. Jaehyun Park, Stanford
5. `not_covered/dp.pdf`: Md. Shakil Ahmed, s/w engineer, Astha IT research & consultancy ltd.
6. `not_covered/Division 1.pdf` : IIT KGP

Sorry if I missed any credits. 

I will try adding more stuffs and keeping this updated.
Also I have added a 'link' file to add good links. Feel free to share and contribute.

PS: not_covered is named so because I didn't touch upon them in my talk.
